# Data-Summariser
A shiny app to drag and drop csv files to get fast data summaries of the data set.

* This application is a student project which was built using R, and Shiny
* Javascript allows for data drag and drop and data refresh.
* A little bit of CSS was used to style the dashboard.

# Motivation

This tool helps to look at a dataset visually without running any code. This *might* help in
reducing the time needed to understand the data. One *drawback* of this is that, it only works with *.csv* files at the moment.
